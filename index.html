        <h4>Voices of Europe: Mapping Cultural and Linguistic Diversity in Eurovision Song Lyrics</h4>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">A project analyzing Eurovision songs from a linguistic perspective</h3>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Since its establishment in 1956, the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) has functioned as more than a musical competition. It is a recurring transnational event in which participating countries present linguistic, cultural and symbolic identities to an international audience. Language choice in song lyrics plays a particularly visible role in this process, as it reflects tensions between national identity, cultural proximity and international accessibility. As such, Eurovision provides a valuable corpus for examining how language operates within popular culture and how linguistic choices relate to broader geopolitical and cultural dynamics.</p>
        <p>While existing research has often focused on voting behavior or political alliances, fewer studies have conducted systematic, large-scale analyses of song lyrics and thematic content across multiple languages and over time. From a digital humanities perspective, Eurovision song lyrics offer an opportunity to combine computational analysis with cultural interpretation. In this project, language families are used as a theoretical framework, as they represent shared linguistic heritage and historical connections between nations.</p>
        <p>The overarching research question guiding this project is: <b>How do the Eurovision Song Contest participants’ song lyrics and linguistic choices reflect geopolitical and cultural ties between the nations?</b></p>
        <p>To address this question, our project investigates four interconnected sub-questions:</p>
        <p>1. What similarities and differences exist among the topics and vocabularies of song lyrics in languages of shared language families?</p>
        <p>2. How have the language choice and topic/vocabulary trends of each contest’s top five most highly rated songs changed across the 2008-2025 timeframe?</p>
        <p>3. How are different languages used together in bilingual or multilingual songs, particularly with English functioning as a lingua franca on the international stage?</p>
        <p>4. How have participating countries used other nations’ languages in their songs?</p>
        <p>Accordingly, hypotheses were outlined for each sub-question:</p>
        <p>1. Songs within the same language family will share greater lexical and thematic similarity than songs across different families.</p>
        <p>2. Highly ranked songs will display more standardized language choices and thematic patterns over time.</p>
        <p>3. English will most often appear alongside national languages in multilingual songs as a means of increasing accessibility rather than replacing local identity.</p>
        <p>4. The use of non-native languages will reflect cultural affiliation or regional proximity between countries.</p>
        <p>Overall, this project aims to explore how digital humanities' methods can illuminate linguistic and cultural dynamics within Eurovision, offering a structured and comparative perspective on how language functions in one of Europe’s most visible cultural events.</p>
