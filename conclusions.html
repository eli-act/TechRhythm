        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Our project set out to examine how Eurovision Song Contest participants’ linguistic choices between 2008 and 2025 reflect broader geopolitical, cultural and communicative dynamics. Across vocabulary and topic analysis, social network analysis and geospatial visualizations, a shared conclusion can be made: Eurovision acts as a shared cultural space not only for the content of the presented songs, but also for the languages and vocabulary they contain. Both linguistic standardization and diversity coexist here, shaped by the countries’ geopolitical and cultural ties as well as the representing artists’ personal, identity-driven expression.</p>
        <p>Textual analysis across language families demonstrates that while Eurovision lyrics converge strongly in form, relying on a shared, repetitive performative vocabulary, they diverge more clearly at the level of thematic focus. Language families influence how meaning is structured, with Indo-European languages aligning most closely with Eurovision’s dominant norms, while Uralic and smaller language groups retain greater thematic individuality.</p>
        <p>Analysis of the top five ranked songs reveals that, although English has historically functioned as a dominant and “safe” language choice, its dominance has lessened in recent years, with non-English and multilingual entries increasingly achieving high rankings. This shift suggests growing audience acceptance of linguistic authenticity and cultural specificity.</p>
        <p>Social network analysis further confirms English language’s role as a lingua franca, acting as a central bridge language in bilingual and multilingual songs, while also revealing stylistic and symbolic uses of other languages that extend beyond national borders. Finally, the geospatial language map highlights how non-native language use often follows patterns of regional proximity, shared linguistic heritage or strategic audience targeting, while some countries choose to use their own languages due to their reach in the global music industry or in order to highlight their national identity on the international stage.</p>
        <p>Altogether, these findings show that Eurovision’s linguistic landscape reflects a negotiation between international accessibility and local identity, revealing how language functions as both a communicative tool and a cultural symbol within Europe’s most visible musical event.</p>
