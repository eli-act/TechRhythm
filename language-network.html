        <h2>Language Network</h2>
        <p>Social network analysis has been used to investigate the sub-research question: How are different languages used together in bilingual or multilingual songs, particularly with English functioning as a lingua franca on the international stage? The Gephi visualization software allows us to create a language network where the nodes are all 55 languages used in the 2008-2025 Eurovision Song Contests, and the weighted edges represent the number of times each connected language pair has been used together in a song, showcasing both dominant co-use and meaningful outliers.</p>

        <p>The most noticeable pattern is the centrality of English, which is by far the most connected language in the network, acting as a hub through which the majority of other languages are linked. The strongest edges in the dataset all involve English, with English-French (16 times), English-Spanish (13), English-Italian (10) and English-Hebrew (10) co-usage standing out the most. This visually affirms English language’s role as a lingua franca (common shared language among speakers of different native languages) on the international music stage, and also partially confirms our hypothesis that English will most often appear alongside national languages in multilingual songs as a means of increasing accessibility, rather than replacing local identity. However, in most bilingual songs English takes the dominant role, with the majority of lyrics being in English and only select words/phrases being in the other, typically native language of the artist, suggesting that this accessibility may be prioritized over more authentic expressions of local identity. Interestingly, the English-French connections are not solely driven by artists from France, as only seven of the sixteen song examples originate there. This suggests that French, more than any other language, is used as a stylistic choice beyond national boundaries, often paired with English to evoke cultural or genre-specific associations. This also makes sense considering that historically, French has been a more local shared language for many European countries where it is an official language, and that French, along with English, is the joint official language of the European Broadcasting Union, with the Contest’s hosts always presenting information in both languages as a tradition.</p>
        <p>The dominance of Romance languages (French, Spanish and Italian) in the strongest English pairings reveals a narrative of linguistic compatibility shaped by global pop traditions. Romance languages are widely recognizable and melodic when used in popular music genres (e.g. Latin music), making them complementary to English. At the same time, the presence of English-Hebrew as an equally strong pairing complicates a purely Eurocentric reading. Belonging to the Afro-Asiatic language family’s Semitic language branch, the presence of Hebrew language suggests that diaspora audiences and historic geopolitical connections to the contest can also influence multilingual practices in Eurovision. Thus, while linguistic and geographic proximity between countries is seen strongest, it is not the only factor affecting language co-use.</p>
        <p>Beyond the strongest Romance language edges, English also connects moderately well to other Indo-European language branches, especially Slavic and Hellenic, as represented by Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Bulgarian and Greek (each linked 4 times). These connections indicate a pattern in which English serves as a bridge language, enabling artists from smaller linguistic markets to participate in the international music industry. The visualization also reveals differences in connectivity – many languages appear only in conjunction with English and never connect to each other directly. This pattern suggests that multilingualism in Eurovision is often asymmetrical: the first and strongest bilingual pairing not including English, which is the French-Spanish pair, only appears 3 times, emphasizing how rarely multilingual songs exclude English entirely. This further reinforces English’s gatekeeping function in Eurovision, especially at the beginning of our timeframe.</p>
        <p>Looking beyond the most visible patterns, the nodes of unusual languages such as Latin and Ancient Greek may represent symbolic rather than communicative linguistic functions. These languages are not used for everyday speaking, but rather artistic purposes, often symbolizing historic or intellectual topics. Another important narrative concerns the representation of artist heritage: languages such as Sranan Tongo, Sami, Swahili, Sanskrit and Arabic appear as peripheral nodes, often connected only once, typically to English. They suggest that multilingual songs are also spaces for expressing more personal cultural identities that may differ from the representative country. English in these cases can act as a bridge that allows languages from beyond Eurovision-participating countries to be perceived within music by the international audience. Finally, nine outliers – Belarusian, Breton, Corsican, Dutch, Estonian, Norwegian, Slovak, Swedish and even imaginary language – appear as isolated nodes. These outliers appear to reflect use of language to represent local ethnic groups (e.g. Breton and Corsican in France) or to express purely local identities, relying on the strength of the message within music rather than more accessible lyrics in English.</p>
        <p>Overall, the network visualization demonstrates that bilingual and multilingual Eurovision songs are shaped by a balance between international reach and local identity. The English language tends to take on the role of a bridge for the audience members accessing international music beyond the boundaries of their native languages, confirming our initial hypothesis, while exposure to other languages contributes cultural identity representation and narrative depth to the songs.</p>
