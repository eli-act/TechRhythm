        <h2>Language Map</h2>
        <p>We have used geospatial visualization and analysis to investigate the sub-research question: How have participating countries used other nations’ languages in their songs? Since language use does not conform to a single country’s borders, GIS visualization via the QGIS platform is a helpful way to spatially represent language use patterns in the shared cultural space of Eurovision, depicting the relationships of 48 participating countries and their 43 official languages.</p>

        <p>This map visualizes the relationships between a source country and its target countries whose official languages the selected source country has used in its songs, with the labels providing information on the number of such songs and the years they were sent to the Eurovision Song Contest. Between 2008 and 2025, some Eurovision participants have increasingly integrated languages from other nations into their performances, although the priority, especially in bilingual native-English language pairings, continues to be the country’s own official or minority language. The use of English is present across nearly all participating countries, corresponding to the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta and Australia as target countries. Besides these countries themselves, only 2 countries have used English in every song from this period – Azerbaijan and Germany (all 18 times), followed by Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Sweden (17 times) and Latvia (16 times). On Germany’s part, despite German being a globally significant language and Germany being one of the Big 5 countries with automatic entry into the Eurovision final each year, German language songs have historically performed inconsistently at Eurovision in this timeframe. Since 2008, the local broadcaster has selected artists already producing English language music for global markets, seemingly having less faith in the success of their own language based on historic voting trends. Similarly, in the case of Azerbaijan (and countries like Sweden and Denmark), an explanation could be that historic success when sending English languages songs has reinforced English as the “safe” option. The presence of 3 Scandinavian countries in this statistic appears to reflect the high English proficiency and the local music industry’s West-leaning nature, while smaller countries like Belgium and Latvia may choose to rely on English as a language with significantly larger reach than their own small populations’ languages.</p>
        <p>Besides English, geospatial patterns of regional linguistic borrowing also appear, like Finland having targeted use of Swedish (a minority language in Finland) in 2012 and German in 2025, while Latvia and Lithuania each feature songs in Russian in 2009. These patterns reveal cross-border cultural proximity, and, in the case of the Baltic countries – the presence of Russian-speaking minorities, the post-Soviet cultural influences and the strategic choice based on the Contest being held in Moscow that year. Similarly, smaller countries such as Luxembourg, San Marino and Malta occasionally incorporate languages also used by their larger neighbors, reflecting both historical linguistic influences and practical considerations of audience reach. For example, San Marino incorporates both Italian and Spanish across different years, seemingly using a linguistic strategy to gain listeners from neighboring countries beyond its limited domestic audience.</p>
        <p>Looking at countries with less diverse language choices, the native language is most favored by Spain (17 times), France (16), Italy and Portugal (15) and Serbia (14). All except Serbian are Romance languages from Southern Europe, reflecting these languages’ associations with emotional expressiveness, established international music presence (e.g. Portuguese and Spanish in South America). Three of these countries (Spain, France and Italy) are also part of the Big 5, so the guaranteed entry to the Eurovision final reduces pressure to rely on English as a lingua franca for audience reach. In the case of Serbia, its strong self-targeting contrasts with neighboring Balkan countries that rely more heavily on English, suggesting that Serbia’s broadcaster might have consciously chosen a national identity-driven linguistic approach to Eurovision as an international stage. Similarly, geopolitical factors appear to have influenced a shift in Ukraine’s language choices: earlier entries were almost exclusively in English, but every entry since 2020 has been in Ukrainian or joint English-Ukrainian, reflecting the need for increased local cultural identity expression due to the pressures of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war.</p>
        <p>Overall, the map suggests two parallel narratives: the reliance on English as a bridging language shared by speakers across Europe, as well as the culturally motivated borrowing of regional languages, reflecting historical ties, identity expression and audience targeting. The hypothesis that the use of non-native languages will reflect cultural affiliation or regional proximity between countries is confirmed by the examples above, also aligning with the analysis of the social network visualization in the previous section.</p>
